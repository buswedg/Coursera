Python resources

This module requires a basic knowledge of Python to perform the programming assignments.

I recommend to take the interactive tutorial at: http://learnpython.org, the "Learn the basics" section should be enough.

Then if you want to learn more about Python, even if not necessary for this class, you can check the Coursera class:
