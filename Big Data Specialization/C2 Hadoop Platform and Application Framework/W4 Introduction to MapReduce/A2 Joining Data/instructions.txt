Hadoop Platform and Application Framework
Assignment: Joining Data 

Introduction to Map/Reduce Module, Programming Assignment, Lesson 2
Exercise in Joining data with streaming using Python code

In Lesson 2 of the Introduction to Map/Reduce module the Join task was described. In this assignment, first you are given a Python mapper and reducer to perform the Join described in the video (3rd video of lesson). The purpose of the first part of this assignment is mostly to provide an example for the second part. Your second assignment will be to modify that Python code (or if you are so inclined write one from scratch) to perform a different Join. You will asked to upload an output file(s).

Please read through all the instruction and if you are not a programmer, especially the programming notes. It is not a hard programming assignment, but I believe worth the effort to understand the nature of map/reduce framework.

PART 1
1. Follow the steps from the Wordcount assignment to set up the following files on Cloudera: join1_mapper.py join1_reducer.py join1_FileA.txt join1_FileB.txt (see below)
Don’t forget to enter the following at the unix prompt to make it executable

> chmod +x join1_mapper.py 
> chmod +x join1_reducer.py

2. Follow the steps from the Wordcount assignment to set up the data in HDFS
3. Test the program in serial execution using the following Unix utilities and piping commands:

(‘cat’ prints out the text files standard output; ‘|’ pipes the standard output to the standard input of the join_mapper program, etc.. )

>cat join1_File*.txt | ./join1_mapper.py | sort | ./join1_reducer.py

To debug programs in serial execution one should use small datasets and possibly extra print statements in the program. Debugging with map/reduce jobs is harder but hopefully not necessary for this assignment, but see the reading notes for the lesson, there are more descriptions of how to debug your code.

4. Run the Hadoop streaming command: (Note that your file paths may differ. Note the ‘\’ just means the command continues on next line. )

> hadoop jar /usr/lib/hadoop-mapreduce/hadoop-streaming.jar \
   -input /user/cloudera/input \
   -output /user/cloudera/output_join \   
   -mapper /home/cloudera/join1_mapper.py \   
   -reducer /home/cloudera/join1_reducer.py

PART 2
5. A new join problem:
a)First generate some datasets using the scripts (see below) as follows:

> sh make_data_join2.txt

(this is a script that produces 6 files:

python make_join2data.py y 1000 13 > join2_gennumA.txt

python make_join2data.py y 2000 17 > join2_gennumB.txt

…)
Use HDFS commands to copy all 6 files into one HDFS directory, just like step2 above and in the wordcount assignment.
Note: These datasets are pseudo-randomly generated so all output is the same for any environment. The files are not large but big enough to make solving the assignment by hand time consuming. One could put the data in a database but that would defeat the assignment purpose!
b)The datasets generated in a) have the following information:
join2_gennum*.txt consist of: <TV show, count>
Description: A TV show title (or maybe its a TV show genre) and a count of how many viewers saw that show, for example:

Almost_News, 25

Hourly_Show,30

Hot_Cooking,7

Almost_News, 35

Postmodern_Family,8

Baked_News,15

Dumb_Games,60

…
join2_genchan*.txt consists of: <TV show title, channel>
Description: A TV show title and the channel it was shown on, for example:

Almost_News, ABC

Hourly_Show, COM

Hot_Cooking, FNT

Postmodern_Family, NBC

Baked_News, FNT

Dumb_Games, ABC

…
c) Your Task: Implement the following join request in Map/Reduce:
What is the total number of viewers for shows that are on ABC?

(The show-to-channel is Many-to-Many. In other words, each show might appear on many channels, and each channel might broadcast many shows.

In pseudo-SQL it migth be something like: Select sum( viewer count) from File A, File B where FileA.TV show = FileB.TV show and FileB.Channel='ABC' grouped by TV show)
c) Upload the resulting output from the reducers, use numReduceTasks=1
Output: <TVshow title, total viewers of that show>

For example, from the above file snippets the output would be:

Almost_News 60

Dumb_Games 60

…
d)Data Notes:

1 TV show titles have no blank;

2 Channels have 3 letters

3 TV show titles appear multiple times, with different counts

4 TV show and channel might also appear multiple times

5 TV show could appear on multiple channels

6 The output should have no commas or punctuation, only 1 blank between title and number

e)Programming Notes and Detailed Suggestions:

You should be able to use 1 map/reduce job. If you are not a programmer then you should review the join1 code, and wordcount code. In fact, you should consider starting with the join1_mapper and join1_reducer. I believe all the logic and function examples you will need are in the wordcount and join1 code

Hint 1: The new join mapper is like join1 mapper but instead of stripping dates from the key field it should be selecting rows related to 'ABC'.

In Python strings are character arrays, and they can be declared and accessed as follows:

my_string = 'LMNOP'

my_string[0:3]='LMN'

In Python there is a string function to check if a string is just digits:

my_string.isdigit() will return True or False.

Hint 2: The new join reducer is like join1_reducer but instead of building up a list of dates & counts, it should be summing viewer counts to keep a running total. Make sure you understand what will be in the intermediate output files that become reducer input (after the mapper and after Hadoop shuffle & group). Look carefully at the groups that are present in the reducer input to see what conditions your reducer will have to check for. You can test the mapper output using the Unix piping mentioned above.

Hint 3: This new join task has someoverlap with wordcounting task, and you might also look the wordcount code to review the counting and updating logic, as well as functions that handle strings and integers.

Hint 4:

Here is one possible pseudo code of how to implement this join, using tv-show as the key:

join2_mapper:

read lines, and split lines into key & value

if value is ABC or if value is a digit print it out

Note that you can test just the mapper by running something like:

>cat join2_gen*.txt | ./join2_mapper.py | sort

Also, recall that if we did have huge files partitioned across a cluster you might have information about viewer counts in one partition, and information about which show is on ABC in another partition. The mapper and the Hadoop shuffle will bring those bits of information together to the same reducer if key is the show.

join2_reducer:

read lines and split lines into key & value

if a key has changed (and it's not the first input)

then check if ABC had been found and print out key and running total,

if value is ABC then set some variable to mark that ABC was found (like abc_found = True)

otherwise keep a running total of viewer counts

Hint 6:

The first two lines of your output should be:

Almost_Games 49237

Almost_News 46592

join1_mapper.py

join1_reducer.py

join1_FileA.txt

join1_FileB.txt

#This mapper code will input a <date word, value> input file, and move date into

#  
#  Note, this program is written in a simple style and does not full advantage of Python 
#     data structures,but I believe it is more readable
#
#  Note, there is NO error checking of the input, it is assumed to be correct
#     meaning no extra spaces, missing inputs or counts,etc..

    line       = line.strip()   #strip out carriage return

#Note that Hadoop expects a tab to separate key value
#but this program assumes the input file has a ',' separating key value

#!/usr/bin/env python

# --------------------------------------------------------------------------
#This reducer code will input a <word, value> input file, and join words together
# Note the input will come as a group of lines with same word (ie the key)
# As it reads words it will hold on to the value field
#
# It will keep track of current word and previous word, if word changes
#   then it will perform the 'join' on the set of held values by merely printing out 
#   the word and values.  In other words, there is no need to explicitly match keys b/c
#   Hadoop has already put them sequentially in the input 
#   
# At the end it will perform the last join
#
#
#  Note, there is NO error checking of the input, it is assumed to be correct, meaning
#   it has word with correct and matching entries, no extra spaces, etc.
